      THE STORY
    </h6>
    <p>
      Designing and planning events can be quite difficult. However, if approached with care and enough research the event has a great chance of success. Etsy puts together a lot of events locally to bring the community closer together, but for it’s 10th anniversary Etsy’s users get to go to the Moon! I’ve explored different ways to help people sign up for the event and below I will share my thought process and some of the ideas I had along the way, as well as reasoning behind my decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprisingly, I found myself writing this long story about the Moonniversary and had to remind myself to stay on track and focus on the product design itself. However, it’s hard to design a product without enough context, without a story. And just like every story, product design has a beginning, a middle and an end.  
    </p>
    <h2 class="f2-ns black-80 pt4">
      Understand the problem and the goal 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before I start designing anything, I first try to understand the goal and the intent of the design. I ask questions like, “What are we trying to achieve with this feature or this product? What’s our objective? What’s the problem we’re solving?”.
    </p> 
    <p>
      I like how Rebekah Cox (early Facebook and Quora designer) <a href="https://rebekah.quora.com/Design-Quora-Web2-0-Expo-Presentation" class="my-link3 black-80">describes product design</a>: “Design is a set of decisions about a product. It's not an interface or an aesthetic, it's not a brand or a color. Design is the actual decisions.” The more information we have about what we’re trying to achieve and what problem we’re trying to solve &mdash; the better our product decisions are going to be. A clearly defined goal will help me navigate through the design project I’m working on.
    </p>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray">
      OBJECTIVE
    </h6>
    <p>
      <i>Design an end-to-end experience that makes users aware of the event, allows them to sign up for it, and helps them get ready for the trip, if chosen.</i>
    </p>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray">
      SCALING
    </h6>     
    <p>
      <i>How many people should we invite?</i>
    </p>   
    <p>
      The number of people we can invite is an important factor since it will determine the activities we’re going to have on the trip. While I could go big and consider inviting thousands of people, I’ve decided to take a more <i>scalable</i> approach. 
    </p>
    <p>
     I was designing under the assumption that Etsy has never done this kind of a trip before, therefore we should approach it carefully. Inviting a smaller group of people will make the event easier to manage and this experience will help us scale better for future events. Otherwise, we’re at risk of disappointing a lot of people if something goes wrong. There are other reasons why taking too many people might not be the best idea:
    <p>  
    <ul class="lh-ul pv2 ph4">
      <li>From my personal experience of attending small, medium and big events, I know how hard it is to coordinate an event and make it enjoyable for everyone.  
      <br>
      <li>Another factor is human connection. I’ve heard from peers that attending social events with more than 80 people is often overwhelming and exhausting.
      <br>
      <li>How much more exposure and other returns are we going to get if we invite one thousand people instead of one hundred? More research needed.
    </ul>
    <p>
      I concluded that it would be best to invite 100 people, at least on the first trip of this scale. If the organization and execution of this trip ends up being amazing, then we know that we can invite more people on the next trip.
    </p>
    <h2 class="f2-ns black-80 pt4">
      Identify, research and plan
    </h2>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray">
      RESEARCH
    </h6>
    <p>
      I’ve also looked up some of the events that Etsy had organized in the past to see the copy and how the event was set up and communicated as well as get the sense of visual design. I remember a few local events Etsy has put together which led me to think that there have got to be event guidelines on Etsy. They were easy to find:

    </ul>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray ttu">
      Competitive analysis
    </h6>
    <p>
      Since no company has celebrated an event on the Moon before, I was trying to find how similar companies such as Pinterest, Ebay and Folksy set up and organize big events to get some ideas and see what I can learn from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was researching how others do events, I’ve also looked up best practices for events and best activities on things like trips abroad.
    </p>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray ttu">
      Keeping the user in mind
    </h6>
    <p>
      <i>Who is our audience? What’s their interests?</i>
<p>
  Anything could be helpful in getting to know the audience that using your product. Even where people are coming from tells you something about the user. On top of researching Etsy's persona I've decided to get some qualitative feedback from people I know.

      <b>Survey and Interview</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Emailing a survey to the people we’ve invited would be one of the best ways to find out what they would enjoy doing the most on the trip. Additionally, we may consider talking to people over the phone or in person to learn more about their preferences. I’ve asked a few of my friends who in my opinion represent Etsy’s target audience about some of the activities they’d enjoy if they were to go to the Moon. I was asking questions like, “What would be an activity that you’d really enjoy on the trip to the Moon and on the Moon itself? Does activity A, B, or C sound like fun to you?” I came up with a few ideas I’ll discuss below.
    </p>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray ttu">
      Making it into something special
    </h6>
    <p>
      Drawing form feedback, I tried to come up with activities that Etsy’s people would enjoy. I was trying to keep it around arts and crafts, cooking and generally fun activities most people enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ideas I had in mind for the audience:
    </p>
    <ul class="lh-ul pv2 ph4">
      <li>Inviting a celebrity guest on the trip to Moon. A celebrity that is popular among the audience (e.g., Neil DeGrasse Tyson or Maira Kalman) can teach people about space travel or host art classes.  
      <br>
      <li>Sending people a care package when they’re chosen. The package includes some of the small useful gear they can take with them to the Moon. If such an activity is allowed on the Moon, provide the event participants with tools and invite them create an unforgettable souvenir containing a moon rock to take back to Earth — probably the best souvenir possible as a memory.
      <br>
      <li>Giving people packages during the the trip with the Moonniversary branding. Each package would include a notebook to jot down ideas, memories, and impressions and Moon-themed souvenirs like a Moon miniature, posters, stickers, a reusable water bottle. It would be great to take a big group photo of everyone on the Moon and then send people a printed version of the photo after the trip (as well as email it to them).
      <br>
      <li>Mailing people a nice postcard as an invitation to sign up (in case our email won’t get to them).
    </ul>
    <p>
      Other ideas for activities on the trip:
    </p>
    <ul class="lh-ul pv2 ph4">
      <li>Offer a variety of activities that people can enjoy instead of making everyone participate in one big activity. There will be people with different backgrounds on this trip and some of them might be interested in one activity but not the other — it’s important to give people a choice so that everyone can enjoy the trip. 
      <br>
      <li>No-gravity sports: volleyball, tennis, ping-pong games.
      <br>
      <li>An astronomy lesson.
      <br>
      <li>A space where people can hang out and socialize, get to know each other, exchange ideas.
      <br>
      <li>Watching a movie (e.g., Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey).
      <br>
      <li>Cooking on the trip.
      <br>
      <li>“Marking” the Moon (if allowed) - make art to leave behind on the Moon.
    </ul>     
    <p>
      Identifying opportunities beyond community building. What else can we do that provides value for Etsy and it’s user?

      <br>
      <li>Partnerships with sellers and buyers — discounts, promotions prior to the event.
      <br>
      <li>Educating the users about better Etsy practices 
      <br>
      <li>Conducting unobtrusive user research among the trip participants.
      <br>
      <li>Promoting Moon-related goods at Etsy
      <br>
      <li>Brand recognition (this is one yuuge)
      <br>
      <li>Making and selling Etsy’s own merchandise during the event
    </ul> 
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray ttu">
      Platform
    </h6>
    <p>
      I decided to use email to communicate with the users because it’s one the main ways of inviting people to events. I asked my friends about the ways they usually learn about events and where and how they would prefer to get invited. Email was almost always the answer. While I was considering mailing a personal letter to invite someone to the event and/or notifying them through the Etsy app — I couldn’t find enough convincing reasons to use those methods of communication. If we’re mailing a personal letter then a person has to switch between the physical letter and a computer to sign up and find the event on the web — which requires a lot more actions on the user’s side and makes it easy to for them to get lost. When considering in-app notification, I couldn't find many apps that do that, which means that people are not used to that form of invitation and may be more likely to dismiss or skip it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping in mind that an average interaction on a smartphone is about 38 seconds, I’ve decided to focus most of my mocks around web browser view. However, I believe it’s important to still give users the ability to fill out the forms and complete the entire registration process on their phones because some people might be very far from their computers and many people in <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/07/21/in-china-more-people-now-access-the-internet-from-a-mobile-device-than-a-pc/" class="my-link3 black-80">Asian countries</a> access the internet primarily from their smartphones, not PC’s.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Another benefit from having people apply for an invitation through Etsy’s website (moon.etsy.com) is to drive sign-ups on Etsy and give people an option to explore what Etsy offers. That brings us to the next point (include image sections where signup form links to Etsy)
    </p>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray ttu">
      Criteria of selecting who gets to go on the trip
    </h6>
    <p>
      <i>Who should we take on the trip?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Location</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve checked where Etsy operates and found out that it ships everywhere around the globe — which means that everyone is a part of the community. Since global community is the heart and soul of Etsy, I’ve decided not to limit sign-ups by location and give everyone a chance to apply for a spot on this trip. Let’s bring people from all over the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was considering a lottery at first but then I thought it wouldn't make much sense because we might end up with people who are not very serious about the trip. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pricing</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s make it $100 per person — to filter out people who are not serious about the event. Since the space is limited and we have a big community, we want to invite people who really want to be a part of this amazing trip. Another good reason to charge some fee for the trip is to help Etsy with covering some of the expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This pricing issue in particular made me think a lot. Pricing is hard if you don’t have enough data about the users’ and company’s data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Other criteria</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important that we choose people who are excited to get to know their fellow Etsy users and are set on enjoying and making the most out of the trip to the Moon. I was thinking that it would be great if we have users write a short essay about why they would want to go to the Moon. That would allow us to learn what’s driving them and find out more about our users. It may also give us a better idea about some of the activities people are interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unbiased selection committee comprised of Etsy employees will choose 100 applicants from all over the world to invite them on this trip. The selection would be mostly based on the essays the applicants submit, but the users’ activity (purchasing and selling) on the website will also be taken into account. I think it would be great to have a diverse mix of some of the most active and engaged people on the website as well as users that show great potential in becoming an integral part of the Etsy community. It is my hope that this way of selecting participants would encourage exchange of ideas and practices between the users during the trip and help us understand and learn more from the individual experiences of our users.
    </p>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray ttu">
      Constraints
    </h6>
    <p>
      This is supposed be a design exercise and I had to wear a few hats simultaneously (designer, PM, researcher, etc.) and make a lot of hard decisions. I’ve chosen to identify and focus on the most relevant parts of the experience, the ones that will drive most impact. There are other important features and issues that I was considering designing but they didn’t make it into the prototype. Here are some that I had to leave out:
    </p>
    <ul class="lh-ul pv2 ph4">
      <li>Offer a variety of activities that people can enjoy instead of making everyone participate in one big activity. There will be people with different backgrounds on this trip and some of them might be interested in one activity but not the other — it’s important to give people a choice so that everyone can enjoy the trip. 
      <br>
      <li>Language and translation. It was probably the hardest part to leave out, but it would take a lot more research and time.
      <br>
      <li>Animations and subtle interactions.
      <br>
      <li>Professional photography that demonstrates the appeal the trip and the experience.
      <br>
      <li>More feedback and feedback from testing the real product.
      <br>
      <li>Visa, legal, and medical issues.
      <br>
      <li>Thorough usability test.
      <br>
      <li>Prototyping in code (even though I really like the lightweight Etsy’s design system).
      <br>
      <li>Offer different pricing depending on accommodation selected.
    </ul> 
    <p>
      <b>Copywriting and context</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      You might wonder why I spent so much time writing about the event, activities and constraints — that’s because I believe that design follows content. <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/why-content-comes-first/" class="my-link3 black-80">Content comes</a> first because it speeds up production, design research and establishes the right information architecture to convey the message properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a big proponent of trying to include proper copywriting at early stages of the design process and avoiding dummy text. A big part of design is communicating a message, and if we know what our message is — we can design around it better. Designing without the proper context could result in an unexpected block and a re-design of a feature and/or page architecture.

      Signup
    </h6>
    <p>
      I’ve explored a few ways to structure the event page where people read the event description and sign up. I was considering having both the event description and the sign-up form to be on the same page, however in this case the cons outweigh the pros. We want people to commit and read the event description to make sure they’re eligible. That’s also a reason why I’ve decided not to include a sign-up button and other navigational links traditionally at the top — so that the users read the event description first.
    </p>
    <div class="mv5 pr1">

      <p>
        We’re going to have a lot of applicants, so I decided to leave out the address field for the purpose of keeping this invite short and concise. For the purpose of selecting the trip participants, we only need to know the information relevant to making the decision at this step of the process. However, I think it is important to make sure the person didn’t leave the country since it is one of our selection criteria. Therefore, it would be a good idea to ask them if they’re still in the same country, if they click “No” — then we can give them a dropdown menu.

      designing forms
    </h6>
    <p>
      There are number of ways we can decrease errors and completion time when designing forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inline validation — gives people real time feedback in places they didn’t know they might need it. Let’s help them get to the right answers quickly. For example, if a person only puts one letter in his first name — we can show an error to ask for a change while the person is on the same section of the page.
    </p>
    <div class="mv5 pr1">
      <img class="w-100" src="images/etsy-inline.png"></img>
      <p style="margin: 0 auto !important; padding: 0;" class="f6 black-40 tc">
        <span class="">
        </span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Using the information we know about the user already and filling it out for them or suggesting it. For example, if we know their address — that section can already be filled out and they can edit it if they want. However, we want to make sure they check if the auto-filled information is correct, because some of the it could be outdated.
    </p>
  <div class="flex flex-wrap mt4-ns mb5">
    <div class="item flex-auto w-50-ns pr2-ns">

      Other ways we can reduce error rate and completion time is by offering Apple Pay (or Android Pay/Google Wallet). Currently I'm using Paypal on Etsy which is another great way to checkout quickly, but when on mobile — Apple Pay is even faster. Using appropriate keyboard on mobile — Dialpad when input only requires numbers also speeds up the process.

      avoiding dead ends
    </h6>
    <p>
      After a user applied for an invite, we want to avoid a dead end and instead offer them more actions to engage with Etsy. For example, “Related items” — display items for sale that are Moon and space-themed. We can also display items that they’ve been shopping for from their last search and thus lead them to “Continue Shopping”, depending on whether it’s a new or a returning user.

      Typography and other UI elements
    </h6>
    <p>
      One of the main criteria in choosing the right typeface was for it to be consistent with Etsy’s product because we want people to recognize the brand if they’re returning users. Another criteria is speed (how fast will it load?) because we don’t want many people to wait for web font to load if they’re coming from a country with a slow internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      That leaves us with system fonts — which is San Francisco (Helvetica for previous Mac OS) for Mac users, Roboto for Chrome OS, Segoe UI for Ubuntu and Arial on Windows. These are sans-serifs only, but to stay consistent with Etsy’s brand we need to pick nice-looking serif family, which in this case is Merriweather from Google Fonts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Etsy’s thorough styleguide came in handy here - not only to set the right colors and spacing, but also to choose proper error states views and other communication patterns.

      Helping to get ready
    </h2>
    </h6>
    <p>
      After we’ve chosen our participants, we can ask them for an address and more specific information such as their preferred activities to find out how much resources we need to prepare for that specific activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage we are also going to help them prepare for the trip. We will provide them with some resources about space travel and the Moon, as well as inform them on what gear to take, where to purchase it, etc.
    </p>
    <b>Duration/Schedule</b><br>
    <i>How long should the trip take? What’s the optimal amount of time that won’t feel like it’s too short but won’t be exhausting either?</i>
    <p>
      Time will be the set to the PTS+8 time zone — because that’s where the launch happens and that’s where we’re coming back to. Easier to keep everyone on the same timeline. To get the most out of the experience but at the same time keep the Etsy’s expenses reasonable, it would be best if the participants spend about 36 hours on the Moon - 2 days and 1 night.
    </p>
    <h6 class="tracked header-gray ttu pt3">
      Reminders, FAQ and more
    </h6>
    <p>
      As part of helping people get ready for the trip, we want to send out an email to remind people about the event a few weeks before to confirm they’re attending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, it would be nice to have some kind of FAQ page on the website about the event if we see that many people ask same questions over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, setting up Slack and/or Facebook group to meet prior to the event and to help people coordinate how to get to the event and help them answer their questions that aren’t addressed on the FAQ page. We will send the participants a calendar invite for the event.
